Settings of the Profiler
========================

Before running the profiler, some settings can be modified. The Menu bar at the upper left of the profiler window displays two Menus:

- **The View Menu**: Allows the user to display or not the different dock windows 
- **The Settings Menu**: Allows the user to modify the Signals and Gvsoc settings. 

The Gvsoc settings allow the user to select the groups of signals whose information he/she wants to get from the profiler backend. Allowing fewer groups of signals minimizes the profiler backend calculations and memory allocation. 

The hotspots Settings allow the user to select for which cores he/she wants to have the hotspots information from the backend. It also minimizes the backend calculations and the memory footprint of the backend if fewer cores are selected.
