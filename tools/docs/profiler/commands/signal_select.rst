Selecting a function on a signal
--------------------------------

A Left Mouse Click on a function of a signal in the Timeline Window automatically highlights the function in blue in the Functions Table. Its source code is also displayed in the source code window if the application compilation occurred in debug mode. 

As an example, in the following image, the "KerConv3x3Stride1_Body_2Out_SQ8" function has been selected by a left mouse click. Its name is highlighted in the Functions table and its source code is displayed in the Source Code window on the bottom right of the profiler window.
