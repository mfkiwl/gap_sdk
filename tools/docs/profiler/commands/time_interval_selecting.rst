Selecting a Time Interval on the Timeline Window
------------------------------------------------

A **Right Mouse Press + Mouse Move & Release** in the Timeline Window allows to **select a time interval** which is materialized by two red bars in the Timeline Window. The  first bar timestamp value is displayed in the Timestamp Text field in the actions bar above the Timeline Window and the time interval value is displayed in the time interval field.

**Right Clicking** with the mouse in the Timeline Window outside the time interval **deletes the time interval** in the Timeline window. 

**Note** that the hotspots information is now relevant to this time interval only.
