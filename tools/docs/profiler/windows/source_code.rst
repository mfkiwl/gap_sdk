The Source Code Window

The source code window displays the source code corresponding to the function hotspot that has been selected by **left clicking** in the hotspot window. The following image displays the source code of the **check_fork** function that corresponds to hotspot #10 within the file ~/gap_sdk/tests/pmsis_tests/quick/cluster/test.c. 
In the left grey column of the window, some hotspot information can be alternatively displayed: 

- **The time Percentage**: the percentage of time that has been spent on this particular line
- **The calls nb**: the number of times the function has been cancelled
- **The total time**: the total time that thas been spent on this particular line

A commands bar allows to check either of this information. Additionally, the hotspot line is highlighted in yellow.
