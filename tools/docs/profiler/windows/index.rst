Other Profiler Windows
======================

Around the central Profiler Window, which comprises the Signals Tree , the Timeline and the Signals Time up statistics (optional) windows, many other dock windows can be displayed. Whether they show up or not can be monitored by the user through the View Menu. 

This menu displays the name of all those optional windows, along with a button that can be checked or not by the user, depending on whether he wants this window to show up or not.

* Moved outside the profiler window by left clicking on the window bar and moving the mouse

* Expanded by left clicking on its edges

* Closed by clicking on the "cross button â€œ on its upper right corner
