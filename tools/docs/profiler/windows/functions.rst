The Functions Window
--------------------

This window displays a chart containing all the functions of the source code that have been called during the application execution. 

Left clicking within the timeline at a given timestamp on a signal will automatically select (in blue) the function that was executed at this timestamp on the GAP chip or on the fabric controller. 

Along with the function names, the chart also displays the total number of cycles used by the execution of this function on GAP9 during the application processing, the number of times this function has been called , and the path to the source file where this function has been implemented.
