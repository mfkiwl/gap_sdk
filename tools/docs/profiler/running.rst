Running the Profiler
====================

To run the profiler, first go to an example. Letâ€™s try the fork  example: 

>cd ~/gap_sdk/tests/pmsis_tests/quick/cluster/fork

Then build the example and run the profiler:

>make all profile platform=gvsoc

This launches the profiler graphics application and the profiler window is displayed with an empty timeline window that will later on display all the GAP9 signals transferred from Gvsoc.
