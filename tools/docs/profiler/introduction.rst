Introduction
============

Profiler is a part of GWT GAP SDK and used with GVSOC, GWT  Full System SoC Simulator. Profiler gives  a visual view of what is happening inside the chip and allows to control the simulator through a graphic interface. Profiler is an extremely useful tool for developing and debugging applications on GAP processors.

Profiler allows you to do many things, from simple GAP core signals display, to fine stall signal analysis, to applications optimization. Following is a list of the most important features:


*  **GAP signals display**:  It displays the internal signals of the GAP processor issued from the Gvsoc simulation  

*  **GAP execution overview**:  It displays a chart with the total number of cycles needed by the application on each processing element.  

*  **GAP cores traces fine analysis**:  It allows to view which function is executed at a given timestamp on any core of GAP chip and on the fabric controller  

*  **GAP cores trace fine analysis**:  It allows to view which function is executed at a given timestamp on any core of GAP chip and on the fabric controller.  

*  **Stall signals analysis**:  It allows you to view all the stall signals of the GAP cores and fabric controller.  

*  **Display of detailed trace Information**:  It allows to see functions information such as calls number, total execution time, stall signals statistics and source & ASM code in different dock windows. 

*  **Display monitoring**:  It allows to select signals by groups, zooming (button, mouse wheel, double click), time intervals measurement, dock windows management. 

*  **Signals Time Up Statistics**:  Calculates the Signals Time Up statistics for a time range selection.
