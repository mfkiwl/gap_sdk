Introduction
============

The GAP SDK allows you to compile and execute applications on GAP processors.

It provides:

- An extensive set of tools including:

   - :ref:`nntool`: a set of tools to easily port NN graphs from various training packages to GAP chips.
   - :ref:`autotiler`: A code generator which can generate a user algorithm (CNN, MatrixAdd, MatrixMult,
     FFT, MFCC, etc) with optimized memory management.
   - :ref:`gvsoc`: a lightweight and flexible instruction set simulator which can simulate GAP processors,
     allowing execution of programs on a virtual platform without any hardware limit.

- Two different operating systems: FreeRTOS and PulpOS
- a common API to create applications that can run on both OSes and interacts easily with other devices
- :ref:`sdk_examples` to help you create your own application.
