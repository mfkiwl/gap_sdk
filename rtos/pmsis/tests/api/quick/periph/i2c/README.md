# I2C tests

I2C tests intent is to test both the hardware and software driver.


# Test descriptions

The test is separated in three parts:
- `unit_tests`: testing I2C individual features
- `stress_tests`: testing the limits of I2C
  - Testing should be performed on both RTL and FPGA platforms.
- `bench_tests`: testing I2C performance
